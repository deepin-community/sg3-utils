.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SCSI OPEN ZONE, CLOSE ZONE, FINISH ZONE, REMOVE ELEMENT AND MODIFY
ZONES or SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command to the \fIDEVICE\fR. All but the last
two are found in the ZBC standard (INCITS 536-2016). The REMOVE ELEMENT AND
MODIFY ZONES command was added in zbc2r07 while the SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command
was added in zbc2r01b.
.PP
One and only one of the \fI\-\-open\fR, \fI\-\-close\fR, \fI\-\-finish\fR,
\fI\-\-remove\fR and \fI\-\-sequentialize\fR options can be chosen.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
sets the ALL field in the cdb.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-close\fR
causes the CLOSE ZONE command to be sent to the \fIDEVICE\fR.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-count\fR=\fIZC\fR
ZC is placed in the Zone Count field in the cdb of all four commands
supported by this utility. ZC should be a value from 0 to 65535 (0xffff)
inclusive.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-element\fR=\fIEID\fR
where \fIEID\fR is an element identifier which is a 32 bit unsigned integer
starting at one. This field is used by the REMOVE ELEMENT AND MODIFY ZONES
command and its default value is zero (which is invalid). So the user needs
to supply a valid element identifier when \fI\-\-remove\fR is used.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-finish\fR
causes the FINISH ZONE command to be sent to the \fIDEVICE\fR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-open\fR
causes the OPEN ZONE command to be sent to the \fIDEVICE\fR.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-remove\fR
causes the REMOVE ELEMENT AND MODIFY ZONES command to be sent to the
\fIDEVICE\fR. In practice, \fI\-\-element=EID\fR needs to be also given.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sequentialize\fR
causes the SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command to be sent to the \fIDEVICE\fR.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIID\fR
where \fIID\fR is placed in the cdb's ZONE ID field. A zone id is a zone
start logical block address (LBA). The default value is 0. \fIID\fR is
assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with '0x' or has a trailing 'h'
which indicate hexadecimal.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_zone is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
